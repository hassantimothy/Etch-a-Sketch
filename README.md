# Etch-a-Sketch

HTML Structure:
Start by creating the basic HTML structure for your Etch A Sketch interface. This will include the drawing area and the control buttons (knobs).

CSS Styling:
Apply CSS styling to create the appearance of the Etch A Sketch frame, drawing area, and knobs. You can use CSS to make it look like the classic toy.

JavaScript Logic:
Implement the JavaScript code to handle the drawing functionality and user interactions.

a. Drawing Area: Set up an HTML canvas element to serve as the drawing area. You can use JavaScript to capture mouse or touch events and draw lines on the canvas based on user input.

b. Knobs (Controls): Implement event listeners for the knobs (buttons) to control the movement of the drawing cursor. Map knob movements to changes in the x and y coordinates of the cursor.

c. Drawing Logic: Write JavaScript functions to update the drawing cursor's position and draw lines on the canvas based on user input.

d. Shake to Clear: Implement a function to "shake" the Etch A Sketch, which clears the canvas by resetting it to a blank state.

Clear Button:
Add a button to the UI that allows users to clear the drawing area without shaking. Implement a function that clears the canvas when the button is clicked.

Optional Features:
Depending on your project's scope, you can consider adding additional features:

a. Color Picker: Allow users to choose different colors for drawing.
b. Line Thickness: Implement options for changing the thickness of the lines.
c. Save and Load: Add functionality to save and load drawings.
d. Share Button: Implement a button to share drawings on social media or save them as images.

Testing and Refinement:
Thoroughly test your digital Etch A Sketch for different scenarios and user interactions. Make sure that the drawing and controls work as expected.

Documentation and Deployment:
Create clear documentation explaining how to use your digital Etch A Sketch. You can host your project on a website or share it through a code repository like GitHub.

Optional Enhancements:
If you're interested in further expanding your skills, you could explore using libraries like Fabric.js or Konva.js to simplify the drawing and interaction logic. These libraries offer features that could make your project more robust and user-friendly.
